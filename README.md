# high-dimensional-statistics-and-machine-learning
from DSTI Course of Pr. Charles Bouveyron - S21
the very nature of modern data (large size, mass of data) does not allow the use of most conventional statistical methods (tests, regression, classification). Indeed, these methods are not adapted to these specific conditions of application and suffer in particular from the plague of the dimension. The latest statistical tools for analyzing modern data and their implementation in realistic situations using the R software will be presented.

Course Objectives:
Learn how to synthesize and extract information from masses of data or
large data
Master modern statistical tools for analysis and decision-making
Know how to implement the recent techniques with the software R
